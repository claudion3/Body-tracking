| `npm install`    | Install dependencies. For client side you will have to navigate in client folder `cd client` then run NPM install              |
| `npm run build`  | Build the project in production mode.                                                                                          |
| `npm start`      | Runs `build` and starts the project (to be used on production servers).                                                        |
| `npm run client` | Runs the client application.                                                                                                   |
| `npm run server` | Runs the server and serves it via Nodemon, meaning that the server will automatically be restarted when you make code changes. |
| `npm run dev`    | Runs `client` and `server` concurrently. _This is generally the command you run for development_.                              |
